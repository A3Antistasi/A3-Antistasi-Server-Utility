# Antistasi Server Utility

This is a server side addon we use to customize our servers a bit: set up proper teamspeak channels, disable global chat at the hardcore server, perform performance logging, etc.
This addon is probably of no interest for anyone else.
The code is now compatible with TFAR 0.9.12 as well as TFAR BETA (updated and tested with version 1.-1.0.325)
